# Kiln Controller

My wife and I recently acquired an old 3-phase 208VAC [L&L Jupiter J230 Manual Kiln](http://www.hotkilns.com/jupiter-manual-kilns-0). My intention is to convert this device from 3-phase to 240v and setup an electronic kiln controller using a Raspberry Pi. The model that we acquired had an existing Kiln Tender, thermocouples for temprature monitoring and an old dial for temprature indication.

I'm going to be tracking ideas and work for this project here and will be using Issues to track the items I want to do.
